\section{Architecture}
Our CCU component computes a single channel's worth of convolution. This allows CCUs to be arranged for a variety of ways that exploits the parallel nature of convolution.

% DIAGRAM REGARDING inter vs intra convolution

Our work focuses primarily on the acceleration of a CCU. Future work could explore how the arrangement of CCUs can affect memory access latencies.

\section{Environment and Experimental Results}
We implement our reconfigurable CCU against the Intel HLS Compiler. Benchmarks and correctness tests are obtained and verified using the ModelSim FPGA simulator. Each benchmark is ran using artificial data with input dimensionality and kernel sizes set to respective layer sizes from CNN architectures. Subsequent diagrams do not have a one-to-one correspondence with their actual hardware implementation due to the HLS translation. Floating point quantization is set to 16 bit precision throughout all implementations.
