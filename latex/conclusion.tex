\chapter{Conclusion}
In this work, we evaluated state-of-the-art CNN-FPGA architectures, their CCUs, and implemented our own reconfigurable CCU using the Intel HLS compiler. We benchmarked our design in simulation using the same layer sizes as the VGG-16 architecture. Results show our implementation is significantly slower than related works.
