\chapter{Conclusion}
In this work, we evaluated multiple CNN-FPGA architectures, their CCUs, and implemented our own reconfigurable CCU using the Intel HLS compiler. We benchmarked our design in simulation using the same layer sizes as the VGG-16 architecture. Results show our implementation is roughly 25x slower than the state-of-the-art CCUs.
