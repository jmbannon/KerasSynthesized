\begin{glossary}
\item[HDL] Hardware definition language, syntax used to describe a hardware design.
\item[FPGA] Field programmable gate array, an integrated circuit designed for consumers to reconfigure with custom ASIC designs via HDL.
\item[HLS] High level synthesis, an abstraction layer for designing HDL in high level languages such as C.
\item[CNN] Convolutional neural network, a class of feed-forward neural networks that uses convolution to detect spacial features.
\item[CCU] Convolutional computation unit, a component within an FPGA that computes convolution layers of a CNN.
\item[MAC] Multiply-accumulate operation.
\item[BRAM] Limited on-chip random access memory within an FPGA.
\item[DRAM] Off-chip random access memory accessible by an FPGA.
\item[DSP] Digital signal processor, an FPGA resource notably used to compute floating point operations.
\item[LE] Logic element, an FPGA resource that perform logic functions, including logic gates, registers, and multiplexers.
